# React + Github API to view commits on this repository ðŸš€

Hi! My name is Matias Dominguez Alonso.

_In this app I use React JS, Material UI, Axios, moment.js, styled-components and Github API to create a table in which you can see all the commits within this same repository. Also I made a small card with my main data which also consumes the Github API_

In the next few days I will be making improvements to this application by implementing a login with a status handling with useContext.

## Start

_If you want to use the app you must follow the following steps:_

```
download & open project folder or clone project
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```
